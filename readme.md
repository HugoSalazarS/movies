# Movies Recommendation Project

## Description

The Movies Recommendation Project is a comprehensive data pipeline that involves the Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) process of a complex dataset. The dataset contains nested columns and missing information, which are handled during the ETL process. 

Once the data is processed, it is made available through the FAST API framework, allowing users to access and interact with the data easily. 

In addition to the data availability, the project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase to explore the relationships between different data elements. This analysis provides insights into the dataset and helps in understanding the patterns and trends within the movie data.

Furthermore, the project includes the development of a Movies Recommendation System. This involves training a machine learning model to recommend movies based on selected movies. The recommendation system is also exposed through the FAST API framework, allowing users to receive personalized movie recommendations.

The final deployment of the project is achieved using the Render tool, which ensures the project is easily accessible and can be deployed in various environments.
